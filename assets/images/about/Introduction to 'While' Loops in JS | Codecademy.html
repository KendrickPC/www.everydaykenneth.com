            <p>The <code>while</code> loop is ideal when you want to use a loop, but you don&#39;t know how many times you&#39;ll have to execute that loop.</p>

<p>In the example you just saw, the computer was randomly flipping a coin: <code>while</code> the coin came up heads (when <code>coinFace</code> equalled 0), it would flip again, and it would stop flipping once it got tails (when <code>coinFace</code> was 1). Since the flip was random, we didn&#39;t know ahead of time how many loops we&#39;d need.</p>

<p>The syntax looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>while(condition){
    // Do something!
}
</code></pre>

<p>As long as the condition evaluates to <code>true</code>, the loop will continue to run. As soon as it&#39;s <code>false</code>, it&#39;ll stop. (When you use a number in a condition, as we did earlier, JavaScript understands <code>1</code> to mean <code>true</code> and <code>0</code> to mean <code>false</code>.)</p>

<p>Since you&#39;ve already mastered <code>for</code> loops, this simpler syntax should be a breeze for you.</p>

            <p>Try it yourself—complete the <code>while</code> loop in the editor so it will print out <code>&quot;I&#39;m learning while loops!&quot;</code>. Do this by adding the condition between the parentheses—don&#39;t change <a href="javascript:void(0)" class="line-no" data-from="5" data-to="">line 5</a>, or you could get an infinite loop!</p>
